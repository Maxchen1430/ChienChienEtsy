# ChienChienEtsy
This repository includes the Project File and Data Set from the Data Analysis of the e-commerce platform, Etsy, for my client, Chien-Chien. 

## Project Summary
My client wished to establish an online e-commerce brand, titled "Chien-Chien", and therefore hired me to conduct a market analysis on Etsy based on a data set of the website from 2021. Despite the slightly outdated information, many of the sellers and brands are still operational on Etsy, thus allowing me to assess the macro-environment of the online market after some data wrangling and appropriate filtering. In this analysis, I proposed several questions, such as "What are the categories associated with each product in the filtered dataframe?" and "Who are the sellers/brands (including the Etsy link)?" in various areas of interest to my client. As the analysis draws to a close, I have also made some strategic recommendations for Chien-Chien as well as compiled an additional SWOT Analysis of the client's current situation.
